Project 1 
# About this project
This project is a part of a Front End Web Dev course at Ironhack.
It features a simple website for a fictional company called Circle which specializes in design and web/app development.

We were asked to follow an interface design uploaded on Figma which included a homepage and two subpages: Projects and Services.

#Technologies Used
	•	HTML5
	•	CSS3
	•	JavaScript


#STRUCTURE

	•	Homepage: The main landing page featuring an introduction to Circle and its services.
	•	Projects Page: A page showcasing the projects undertaken by Circle, fetched from a provided API.
	•	Contact Page: A form where users can reach out to Circle, with JavaScript validation for inputs.


#FUNCTIONALITY
The functionality required the links to connect to other subpages and sections. Additionally, for the JavaScript part, we were tasked with fetching projects from a provided API and loading corresponding projects in the Projects.html. Furthermore, the contact form on the Contact page was required to validate inputs, displaying error messages in case of incorrect entries. Specifically, attempting to type "ironhack" in the Name input triggers a message: "You cannot be Ironhack, because I am Ironhack".
We were also requested to ensure the design is responsive and functions well on both desktop and mobile devices.
